According to a research carried out by Deloitte and Touche, customer-centric companies are 60% more profitable than those not focused on the customer. https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/Strategy/2014_customer_centricity_deloitte_ireland.pdf
And this is precisely why businesses are looking to customer feedback tools as a foundation for this success.
