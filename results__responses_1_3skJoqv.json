The preparation for a Master Plan for the future must reflect in the attitudes of the authorities in the present and the authorities currently seem hell bent on making decisions that are not in favour of the ecology and aesthetics of the city.  The rampant construction of skywalks in the city is a case in point. These skywalks serve more as advertisement platforms than public utilities.  Also, integration of public transport in terms of accessibility and convenience goes a long way in incentivising the population to forego their private vehicles.   The authorities have completely neglected this factor while deciding the location of the Cantonment Metro Station despite many valid counters to their technical arguments by select and credible individuals from the society.  The Kempegowda International Airport is 11 years old but we still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a fully functional Metro/Rail system traversing the 40 km distance from the city to the airport. Reliance on private vehicles to reach the airport is expected in such a situation.

Lack of incentive to use public transport 7. Poor last mile connectivity 8. Major surge in taxi operators and hence 4 wheelers 9. Non existence of limiting vehicle ownership policy 10. Upsurge in 2 wheeler traffic 11. Lack of incentive to walk 12. Existence of corridors of converging traffic and narrowing roads 13. Traffic police is busy fining people than controlling traffic  Here are possible solutions to the above points:  1. Public Accountability of the contractor and the office responsible to ensure road quality - timely inspection and repair, minimum time guarantee being imposed,  usage of apps with location to be able to tag the location of problem and response mechanism along with auto escalation matrix   2. Build and Incentivise public transport use to major hubs of traffic movement - this includes safe and regular last mile connectivity options, incentivising walking via well kept footpaths, overhead bridges, cycle routes. Without last mile, people will still use private transport or autos and taxis   3. Phase out 3 wheelers and introduce 4 wheeler autos - the driving behaviour can be curtailed this way  4. Dedicated bus lanes and non private transport areas within the city - de congest rings to increase public transport utilisation  5. Phase out privately owned 2 wheelers. Only logistics organisations can own them. Provided subsidised public transport usage to this part of public.   6. Private organisations to be forced to implement no 2 wheeler policy.   7.

If people drive in wrong direction and don't follow lanes for turning left or right then any length of width of roads is insufficient. There should be a drive to educate people and enforcement to follow traffic rules. The speed of vehicular movement is slowed down by unauthorized parking on any spot including near the turns, pedestrians crossing every where, vehicles coming in wrong direction, vehicle turning right from the left most lane and left from the right most lane leading to chaos on turnings, very slow movement on traffic signals, un-managed auto movements in every direction. The planned infrastructure looks good on paper but it cannot be sustained without people participation and for that discipline and enforcement is the basic need that is prevalent in every developed country except in India. The master plan should also include a chapter how they plan to handle this basic issue which will increase further with additional number of vehicles on road if not tackled properly. In that case any amount of modern infrastructure will just add to chaos on the roads.  Also, when granting permission to build multistory apartments on narrow lanes of the outer areas, capacity of the roads should be measured and only appropriate number of buildings be allowed or the road capacity should be increased beforehand as it is next to impossible to demolish and residential apartment or other buildings at a later stage and residents have to suffer the never ending traffic blockages throughout the day.

Address problems like these first.\n", "score": 1.3047694458393184}, {"response": "235- Our Traffic system is in a pathetic state. Average peak hour speed between 8:30am-11:30am is about 10-12kms/hr.  Firstly I do not blame the government alone for this problem as citizens are equally responsible for this as we do not follow even the basic traffice rules and common sense is just thrown out of the window when we are in the driving seat, but we should also recognise much of the problems need government to take first initiatives.  So what I propose is that, better traffic management and augmented common services are need of the hour.  1. Traffic violations should be severely dealt with with Impounding of vehicle for weeks or months and the safe keep cost added to fines. Community services should be made part of the fine and repeat violators should be subjected to naming and shaming.  2. Methods should be divised to improve lane driving diciplin and specific training and orientation for 2 wheeler drivers.  3. Corporates occupying large office complexes should be encouraged to devise staggered reporting times for employees to ensure less number of  vehicles at a give time. Further Corporates should also be encouraged to work towards a 30% population of employees working from Home on any give day, unless absolutely required to work from office. Having been in Corporates for 22 years I am confident that it is possible if they try, yes it will have some cost impact but I am confident it will only improve the productivity, which effectively can offset some additional cost.  4. Management and coordination of our shared commute modes like bus and metro needs to improve. Metro where available is a boon but Feeder bus and general bus commute still takes a long time. Traveling on ORR or Richmond road averages between 5-10kms/hr most of t he time during the day, this needs to improve dramatically.  5. Quality of roads are PATHETIC.  However to be positive I believe white topping should improve situation and needs to be done much faster pace, plastic based mix for interior roads should become a norm.

At the first place we need to ease the traffic problems and then think of eradicating it.

All we need to do is setup a barricade  not to let them take that u turn unless they are in the right lane for it.  2) Bus bays: We need to create bus bays whereever they are not there. Using bus bays avoids the blockages by the BMTC buses near the bus stops. 3) Usage of Bus Bays: We are glad that we have bus bays in some areas. Unfortunately  none of the BMTC drivers use them. They fell that it is their right to block the road. Hosnetly if you set right the BMTC drivers by teaching them some road manners, 20% of Bangalore traffic issues will be resolved. Especially the Volvo drivers, just because they have a high end bus, they feel like they own the road. 4) Foot paths: Foot paths should be cleared of all the encroachments.

Build FOB at all major pedestrian crossings and setup grills on the divider (at least 150m on each side of the FOB) in the middle to ensure pedestrians will definitely take the FOB 4. Monitor and close gaps forcibly created in dividers by 2 wheelers for a quick U turn. 5. Have small (fixed traffic cone type) dividers setup near turns so that those who need to turn will go into the correct lane and not obstruct the traffic going straight by occupying all the lanes 6. Remove the compulsory helmet rule as it is only facilitating traffic cops to make a quick buck. Taking care of their safety is the rider's responsibility and not the traffic department's. The seat belt and helmet rules are useless in the current Indian mindset.

These busses does not moved to the sides when they stop. During peak traffic hours, even if the bus stop on the side on the ORR, there will be huge traffic congestion.  One solution for the problem is to make ORR free from BMTC busses, and to have proper connective of service roads in ORR.

In Bangalore,  wherever we go, we find cable TV wires or internet wires loosely hanging on road sides from electric/telephone posts or trees. These cables are laid either by cable TV operators or internet companies. Cables are haphazardly pulled through tree tops and telephone/electric posts to houses/buildings. The left over or unused wires are rolled and kept hanging loosely. Among these there are plenty of unused wires, broken ones dangling touching heads of pedestrians. A child running carelessly or a two wheeler can get entangled with these wires and fall. These companies do not care to remove the old wires/unused wires, laid by them.    To me it seems, at the present scenario, none of the service providers have a secure stable method of carrying the overhead wires to consumers, other than using electric posts/telephone and trees. A stable infrastructure will be useful for both the companies and to their customers  Otherwise, in the years to come such wires will be on the increase creating mayhem, inconveniencing residents, pedestrians and vehicle drivers.     Suggest BBMP or any other agency to provide a permanent/stable infrastructure or  a special  bay for accommodating such cables/wires and rent it out to service providers.  None should be allowed to use electric post or trees for laying cables or internet  wires. You may consider including this item in the master plan, if not already included under any other heads.

Stringent limiting of water use (residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural) should have been put in place when the city's population crossed 5 million. In early 2018 the population is 10 million and the 3 agencies have no water rationing mechanism for the city. An allocation of about 600 litres/day per typical household (see pg 105 for the figures) is far too high for a metro that has lost three-quarters of its water bodies over the last two decades. Projecting a population of 20 million in 12 years with this water allocation per household is incomprehensible and shows just how far out of touch with hydrographic cycles the 3 agencies are.\n", "score": 1.3311263745714772}], "roads": [{"response": "56- 1.quality of drinking water. 2.Renovating all lakes in the city.

My suggestion is to mandatory have bottom stones in roadside drains removed or replaced by seepage gratings every 30 feet.

Water recharge by the govt on such a scale would augment small measures by people in their own residences or apartment complexes.
